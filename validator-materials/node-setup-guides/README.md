# Validator Setup Guides

Welcome to the validator section of our documentation. This section will walk you through the process of installing and running a validator on Findora. If you have questions or need assistance, join the Findora community on [Telegram ](https://findora.org/telegram)or [Discord](https://findora.org/discord) and request for access to the Validator Support channels.

1. First, review the [**System Requirements** ](system-requirements.md)page to understand what type of hardware and software is required to run a validator node on Findora. You will need this information as you proceed further.
2. Next, you must acquire a server. We suggest using a server hosting provider such as Hetzner, Digital Ocean, or AWS. In the [**Aquire a Server** ](acquire-a-server.md)section, we use Contabo as an example of how to rent a virtual server for your validator.
3. Finally, you may choose one of two paths for setting up a validator:\
   \
   [**Manual Setup**](manual-setup.md) **-** This method walks you through the process, step-by-step, one command at a time. This is recommended for first-timers as you get to learn the process before taking shorter, easier paths.\
   \
   [**Toolbox Setup**](toolbox-setup/) **-** This method uses a toolbox to do much of the heavy lifting for you. The toolbox provides you with a set of tools for managing and troubleshooting your validator.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can install the toolbox separately after following the steps in Manual Setup.
